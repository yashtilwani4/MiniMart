# Assets Folder

## Images
Place your app images here:
- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024)

## Icons
Place custom icon files in the `icons/` subdirectory.

For now, the app uses emoji icons and online CDN images for products.
You can replace these with local assets as needed.
